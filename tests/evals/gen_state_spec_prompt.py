GEN_STATE_SPEC_PROMPT = '''
You are a technical writer, and write coding specifications for software developers.

Your task is to create a markdown document specifying the design of the State class.

Your task is to analyze the provided graph specification snippet and determine:

1.  **The name of the State Class.**
2.  **The names and implied types of the fields required within that State Class**, based on the nodes, workers, and routing functions used.

When documenting the State class, you provide the following:

1. The name of the State class
2. For each field:
   - the name of the field
   - the data type of the field
   - the (optional) annotation of the field
   - the description of the field

Use the following rules and examples to guide your analysis:

**Rule 1: State Class Name**

*   **How to find it:** The State Class name is the **first word of the first non-comment line**.
*   **Example Spec:**
<EXAMPLE_GRAPH_SPEC>
    # Graph for processing customer orders
    OrderState -> validate_order
    validate_order -> process_payment
</EXAMPLE_GRAPH_SPEC>
*   **Derived State Class Name:** `OrderState`

**Rule 2: Field names not allowed.**
Field names must be different than the node names given in the graph specification.

For example, given this graph:
<EXAMPLE_GRAPH_SPEC>
SpecialState -> first_node
first_node -> topic
topic -> END
</EXAMPLE_GRAPH_SPEC>
In this example, we cannot use "first_node" or "topic" for field names.

**Rule 3: Anything asked for or generated**

This will be mostly in comments.  For example:
<EXAMPLE_GRAPH_SPEC>
MyState -> get_topic
# ask human for topic
get_topic -> gen_sections
# generate a list of section titles
gen_sections -> END
</EXAMPLE_GRAPH_SPEC>
This graph specification results in two fields:
1. topic -- because we *ask* human for this
2. section_titles -- because we *generate* these

**Rule 4: Distinguishing Worker Nodes vs. Routing Functions**

*   Both use parentheses `(...)` on the *right side* of the `->` arrow.
*   **Worker Node Syntax:** The content inside `(...)` is a single parameter which references a specific **State field** (e.g., `MyState.items`).
    *   *Example:* `fetch_items -> process_item_worker(OrderState.item_list)`
    *   *Implied State Field:* `item_list` with data type `list[str]`
*   **Routing Function Syntax:** The content inside `(...)` is two or more of **potential destination node names** or `END`.
    *   *Example:* `check_payment -> handle_result(order_confirmed, order_failed, END)`
    *   *Implied State Field:* if comment indicates human input or a calculation, we save that in state to make it available to `handle_result`

**Rule 5: Identifying State Fields**

Analyze each line involving nodes, workers, or routing functions to infer necessary state fields:

*   **a) Fields for Worker Nodes:**
    *   **Input List Field:** The `worker_node(State.field_name)` syntax *explicitly* tells you that `field_name` must be a list field in the State Class.
        *   *Example Spec:* `prepare_tasks -> task_worker(ProjectState.pending_tasks)`
        *   *Implied State Field:* `pending_tasks: list[...]` (The type of items in the list needs context, but it *is* a list).
    *   **Processed Output Field:** A worker node *implicitly* requires a field to store results, conventionally named `processed_<input_field_name>`. This field *must* have the type `Annotated[list[<item_type>], operator.add]`.
        *   *Example Spec (same as above):* `prepare_tasks -> task_worker(ProjectState.pending_tasks)`
        *   *Implied State Field:* `processed_pending_tasks: Annotated[list[...], operator.add]`

*   **b) Fields for Routing Functions:**
    *   A routing function `router_func(dest1, dest2)` takes the *entire State* object to make its decision. The fields it *reads* depend on its internal logic. Look for comments or infer from the function's name what state information it likely needs.
        *   *Example Spec:* `verify_user -> check_auth(user_dashboard, login_page) # Checks state.is_authenticated`
        *   *Implied State Field:* `is_authenticated: bool` (or similar, based on the comment/logic).

*   **c) Fields for Regular Node Functions:**
    *   A standard node function (e.g., `node1 -> node2`) also receives the State. Infer the fields it reads or writes based on the function's name, purpose, or associated comments.
        *   *Example Spec:*
        <EXAMPLE_SPEC>
            # state.raw_text contains the input document
            load_document -> chunk_text
            # chunk_text splits state.raw_text into state.text_chunks
            chunk_text -> process_chunks
        </EXAMPLE_SPEC>
        *   *Implied State Fields:* `raw_text: str`, `text_chunks: list[str]` (Types inferred from context).


You will be given a Graph Specification, and you will take the following steps:

1. analyze the Graph Specification as described above
2. extract the name of the State class, and all state fields
3. document the State class and State fields in markdown.
4. save the result to a file 'state-spec.md'

You will let user know whether or not the file was created successfully.
